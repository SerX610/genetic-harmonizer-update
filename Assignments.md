# Assignment 1: Genetic Harmonizer Upgrade

Hey Team,

First off, great job on the genetic algorithm for harmonizing a melody\! Itâ€™s a solid first experiment, and Iâ€™m genuinely impressed with what youâ€™ve put together so far. But, as you know, at our AI music startup, weâ€™re all about pushing boundaries. And I think we can take this to the next levelâ€”especially with our focus on jazz harmony. Letâ€™s make this *sing* (pun intended)\!

Our mission: **re-adapt the genetic algorithm to harmonize a melody in a jazz style.** ðŸŽ·ðŸŽ¼

## Team Roles & Tasks

To tackle this challenge, I suggest we divide and conquer. Hereâ€™s what I need from you, my brilliant music AI engineers:

1. **Jazz Harmony Fitness Metrics:**  
   Develop new fitness metrics that reflect the richness and rules of jazz harmony. Think voice leading, tensions, and avoiding parallel fifthsâ€”jazz style.  
2. **Chords, Chords, Chords\!**  
   Simple triads (e.g., Cm, G) wonâ€™t cut it anymore. Expand our chord palette to include **7th chords, 9th chords, and beyond if you feel particularly fancy**. The more colorful and jazzy, the better.  
3. **Implementation & Refinement:**  
   Adapt and update the genetic algorithm implementation you worked on:  
   * Implement the new fitness metrics.  
   * Add the new chord types.  
   * Decide if the existing fitness scores stay, get modified, or are entirely replaced. This is your callâ€”use your jazz intuition\! ðŸŽµ

Leverage your diverse skill sets\! Have the more music-savvy team members focus on crafting the jazz harmony rules, while the engineering-minded team members handle the implementation. Collaboration is key\!

## Deliverables

Hereâ€™s what I expect at the end of this sprint:

1. **Working Code & Output:**  
   * I should be able to run your code and open the generated MIDI score in music notation software (e.g., MuseScore). I think youâ€™ve already implemented this feature in the first iteration. So, just be sure that this works with the new implementation.  
   * The melody (letâ€™s stick with *Twinkle Twinkle Little Star* for consistency) should be beautifully harmonized with **jazz chords.**  
2. **Documentation of Metrics:**  
   * For each fitness metric, include a short explanation directly in the code as a docstring. Keep it simpleâ€”just explain what the metric evaluates and why itâ€™s relevant to jazz harmony.

Iâ€™m super excited to see what youâ€™ll come up with. Feel free to experiment, get creative, and think outside the boxâ€”this is jazz, after all\! ðŸš€

Letâ€™s show the world what our AI music team is capable of. Good luck\!

Valerio, your CTO
